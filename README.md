# Pok√©Python
Your pokemon player is randomly selected from a total of 15 pokemon sprites every time you restart or advance a level. There are 4 levels of progressively more difficult questions on the Python language, and each correct answer will give a speed boost of 100m (in a 1000m dash). All questions are taken from [My Python Quiz](http://mypythonquiz.com/).

Install with `pip install .` from the project root, and run with `pokepython`.

Thank you Hezu, Clement, Yang Jin, and Kenny for helping to compile the question bank, thank you Kenny for helping pick out the music and making good calls on game rules, and thank you Kenny and Lihwei for that impromptu 1am pair/triplet programming session it was fun.
